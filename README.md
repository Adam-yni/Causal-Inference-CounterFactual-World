Implementation of the paper: [Estimating the Effects of Continuous-valued Interventions using Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.12326), with modifications made to ensure consistency and to convert the code from TensorFlow to PyTorch. The model's flexibility allows for the generation of realistic examples from the perspective of treatment assignment as well as dosage (particularly for continuous treatments) thanks to the two discriminators that respectively inspect assignment and dosage. It is also possible to add additional discriminators for more specific cases where one wishes to control other treatment characteristics, such as the time interval in which the treatment is assigned.
